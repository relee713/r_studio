## My Skills
I have a strong proficiency in R Studio, including key skills such as data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Using packages like tidyverse, ggplot, and gt, I can efficiently clean, filter, and transform data, perform grouping and summarization, and apply various statistical techniques. I am also experienced in creating decision models, simulating outcomes, and generating reports with visually structured outputs. My expertise spans data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and effectively presenting insights for decision-making.

## Quarto
### AstraSync
The "AstraSync" analysis utilized R programming to evaluate a client counteroffer, employing decision trees and simulations to assess profit potential and risks associated with three payment options. 
We applied data visualization techniques to illustrate outcomes and developed models to determine expected values, ultimately recommending Option B for its stability and low risk. 
This project highlighted skills in statistical analysis, data interpretation, and strategic decision-making.

### Avocado 
This script demonstrates skills in data manipulation, analysis, and presentation using R. It employs packages like readr, tidyverse, and gt to load and explore avocado sales data, filter specific regions, and calculate summary statistics such as mean prices and sales values. The project includes data grouping and transformation techniques, as well as formatting outputs in a visually appealing table. This showcases expertise in data wrangling, statistical summarization, and report generation.

### Aviation Consulting 
This project highlights advanced skills in R for decision analysis, including probabilistic modeling, financial calculations, and decision tree visualization. Using R, the team calculated expected profits based on different market scenarios: a 70% chance of generating $120M and a 30% chance of $30M for the new airplane, versus a guaranteed $40M for the older model. The analysis involved calculating outcomes, incorporating probabilities, and visualizing the decision tree using mermaid. This demonstrates expertise in data-driven decision-making, financial modeling, and effective presentation of business recommendations.
