### AstraSync
The "AstraSync" analysis utilized R programming to evaluate a client counteroffer, employing decision trees and simulations to assess profit potential and risks associated with three payment options. 
We applied data visualization techniques to illustrate outcomes and developed models to determine expected values, ultimately recommending Option B for its stability and low risk. 
This project highlighted skills in statistical analysis, data interpretation, and strategic decision-making.
