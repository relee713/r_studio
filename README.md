## AstraSync
The AstraSync analysis utilized R programming to evaluate a client counteroffer, employing decision trees and simulations to assess profit potential and risks associated with three payment options. 
We applied data visualization techniques to illustrate outcomes and developed models to determine expected values, ultimately recommending Option B for its stability and low risk. 
This project highlighted skills in statistical analysis, data interpretation, and strategic decision-making.

## Avocado
This script demonstrates skills in data manipulation, analysis, and presentation using R. It employs packages like readr, tidyverse, and gt to load and explore avocado sales data, filter specific regions, and calculate summary statistics such as mean prices and sales values. The project includes data grouping and transformation techniques, as well as formatting outputs in a visually appealing table. This showcases expertise in data wrangling, statistical summarization, and report generation.

## Aviation
This project highlights advanced skills in R for decision analysis, including probabilistic modeling, financial calculations, and decision tree visualization. Using R, the team calculated expected profits based on different market scenarios: a 70% chance of generating $120M and a 30% chance of $30M for the new airplane, versus a guaranteed $40M for the older model. The analysis involved calculating outcomes, incorporating probabilities, and visualizing the decision tree using mermaid. This demonstrates expertise in data-driven decision-making, financial modeling, and effective presentation of business recommendations.

## Delta
This project showcases strong skills in data analysis and visualization using R. The team performed a comprehensive analysis of airline on-time performance, focusing on Delta Airlines. Using packages such as tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, and gt, they were able to filter and group data by unique airline identifiers, calculate average delays, and create insightful visualizations comparing delay times across different airlines. The analysis included generating summary tables and using ggplot2 to visualize average delays by departure time, highlighting key trends in flight performance. These skills demonstrate proficiency in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and the ability to draw actionable business insights from complex datasets.

## DecisionTree
This project demonstrates advanced skills in stochastic modeling and decision analysis using R. By developing a custom decision tree function, the project evaluates outcomes based on probabilities and matrix operations, calculating expected values for options like future contracts and market prices. Bayesian analysis is applied to assess test accuracy and estimate probabilities in health-related scenarios, while optimization techniques are used to identify critical values that influence decision outcomes. These techniques showcase proficiency in using R to model uncertainty and make informed decisions in complex business or policy contexts.
